Java Collections Framework provides the following benefits:

- Reduces programming effort: you don’t need to invent the wheel anymore, JCF provides useful data structures and algorithms.

- Increases program speed and quality: JCF provides high-performance, high-quality implementations of useful data structures and algorithms. Programs can be easily tuned by switching collection implementation. It is possible because interface implementations are interchangeable. When you use the Collections Framework you don’t need to waste time by writing your own data structures, so you’ll have more time to write and improve your business logic.

- Allows interoperability among unrelated APIs: you can use collections in different applications and be sure that it will work fine. You can exchange your collections between applications seamlessly.

- Reduces effort to learn and to use new APIs: many APIs take collections on input and return them as output. In the past, each API could implement its own collections and you needed to learn it. Now we have a universal solution - JCF.

- Reduces effort to design new APIs: this is the reverse side of the previous benefit. A programmer don’t have to invent and to implement his own collections.

- Fosters software reuse: if you implement your own collection with a JCF interface, you will get a reusable code. You can use collections utilities on your implementation as well.
