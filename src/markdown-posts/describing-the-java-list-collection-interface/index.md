List is an ordered collection that can contain duplicates. In addition to the Collection interface methods, the List interface includes the following:

- Positional access: manipulating the elements by their index in the list. This includes methods such as: get, set, add, addAll, remove.

- Search: methods indexOf and lastIndexOf search for a specified object in the list and return its index.

- Iteration: extends Iterator semantics to take advantage of the listâ€™s sequential nature. With ListIterator you can traverse the list in either direction, modify list during iteration and obtain the current position of the iterator. The listIterator methods provide this behavior.

- Range-view: the sublist method returns a sublist with a specified range of elements.

There are two general-purpose List implementations: ArrayList, which is based on an array, and which is usually the better-performing, and LinkedList, which offers better performance under certain circumstances.
