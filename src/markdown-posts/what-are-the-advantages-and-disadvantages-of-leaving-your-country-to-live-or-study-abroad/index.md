These days many people go abroad to study or even to live. In this essay I'll share some thoughts about living in a foreign country. Moving abroad is a life-changing decision and you have to think through all possible details. Of course it heavily depends on the country where you live and the country where you're going to move, but here I'm talking about moving to a better place to live.

Of course, when you see pictures and videos of a country of your dream, you see many advantages. For instance, people are more polite and the life on the whole is much better. You see those vibrant cities and peaceful villages, surrounded by amazing green valleys. And when you eventually get there, you understand that it's really right up your street... Until the "honeymoon" ends.

Actually it's not so bad, don't be afraid. But there are some disadvantages of living in a foreign country as well. You're inside a different culture, people around you probably don't speak your native language, you don't know how to pay taxes, how to call a doctor. You don't have any ideas about sending a child to a school. You're homesick and depressed. Besides that, you must find a job and rent a flat or a house. No, it sounds really bad. :)

Moving abroad isn't a plain sailing, as well as our life. But don't give up! Follow your dream and go as far as you can. You wanted to start afresh and you've done it. Nowadays you have many options to communicate with your relatives and friends, and they always can support you. Line up your further actions and immerse yourself in your new life, make new friends, broaden your horizons and finally you will succeed.
