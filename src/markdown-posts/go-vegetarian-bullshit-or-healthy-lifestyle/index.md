This is just my English homework, a short essay on topic "Go vegetarian: bullshit or healthy lifestyle". So, here are some thoughts:

There are many people in the world who don't eat meat. Those are vegetarians. Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat and meat by-products. They have different reasons to do it: while some people suppose that it's healthier, others think that it's unethically and violently to grow and then kill animals. As I know, all things can have its own prons and cons, and vegeterianism is not an exception. In this essay I'll try to shortly describe the main advantages and disadvantages of this idea.

On one hand, it's a proved fact that it's really healthier in some cases. Let's have a look: if you're on a vegetarian diet, you consume less cholesterol, harmful fats, and you also consume more antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. Some studies have shown that vegetarians have lower heart desease level than non-vegetarians. In Western medicine patients are sometimes advised to adhere to a vegetarian diet.

Some vegs believe that if there is a way to survive without killing animals, we should't cause harm to them. They also believe that killing an animal can only be possible in extreme circumstances, and that consuming animals meat only because its tasty and nutritious is not a sufficient reason.

On the other hand, the vegetarian diet must be planned carefully. Eating only cucumbers and muesli is extremely unhealthy. You must consume various foods to provide your body with full complex of proteins, carbs, fats and so on.

Many famous people are vegetarian. For instance, Lev Tolstoy, Steve Jobs, and even Adolf Hitler. You may find a huge list of known vegetarians with their interesting life stories on the Internet.

Vegetarianism is also widely promoted in religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism, Jainism and some others.

So, we can see that a good vegetarian diet can improve our health, but we have to be careful when planning our ration, if we want to exclude meat from our life. We can open a new world, a clean world without violence and unhealthy food. Why not to try it?
