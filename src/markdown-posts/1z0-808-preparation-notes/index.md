The process of studying Java Core. The picture was taken from Unsplash.com.

During the preparation time, I was making notes to remember little tricks that I didn't know or forgot. Although I would never recommend using some of the pieces of code from the notes in production, they might be helpful for those who are preparing for the exam.

So, as I mentioned in [this post](/passed-the-oracle-1z0-808-certification/), I will do my best to keep my New Year's resolution and post the most useful notes in my blog. Along with the main topic I will try to explain why some of the code examples should never appear in your production code.

All the posts related to this topic will be marked with a tag [1Z0-808](/tags/1Z0-808/).

Update 06.02.2021: as many New Year's resolutions this one did not work :D
